				<h2>The Significance of Voting in a Democracy</h2>
				<img src="images/hero-image.avif">
				<p>One of the numerous ways citizens can take part in public decision-making is by voting. You have the ability to improve your town and your own and your family's quality of life by casting your ballot. Voting with your neighbours, relatives, and friends guarantees that your common concerns and beliefs are given top priority, that you have a significant say in who represents us, and that you have a say in the allocation of public funds and resources. Our voices gain strength as we cast more ballots, increasing the likelihood that the causes that matter to us will be heard.<br>

					The public is likely to support a government that involves its citizens, makes decisions inclusively, and, most importantly, has the confidence of its voters when it comes to making difficult choices. On the other hand, the people's mandate, which was won handily in an election, has shown itself to be a powerful force for good in situations where the leadership is facing a "crisis of legitimacy" and is perceived to be making decisions more for political reasons than for the benefit of the public.<br>
					
					More importantly, even while the Philippines has embraced democratic traditions of freedom of expression and choice as well as participation, improving the quality of its democracy is still a long-term issue. Despite the advancements, there is still obviously much more work to be done in order to build political parties based on merit and ideology rather than personality, improve government accountability systems, establish alternative trustworthy information sources, and empower voters to make educated decisions.<br>
					
					However, the electorate itself must take the next step. We've seen how a strong mandate for change has brought about change; all we need to do now is demand continuity to keep it going.

				<h2>Characteristics of a Responsible Voter</h2>
				<img src="images/know-your-candidate-know-your-future.jpg">
				<p>If you're choosing a responsible leader, you also need to be a responsible voter. If you have one of these characteristics you can consider yourself a responsible voter.<br>
				Here are the characteristics of a responsible voter:
				</p>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Stays informed by learning about the candidates and issues before voting.</li>
					<li>Thinks critically and doesn't just believe everything they hear or see.</li>
					<li>Keeps an open mind and considers different viewpoints.</li>
					<li>Gets involved in the political process and follows important news.</li>
					<li>Respects democracy by accepting the outcome, even if it's not what they wanted.</li>
					<li>Speaks truthfully and doesn't spread lies or false information.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Steps to Ensure an Informed Decision Before Voting</h2>
				<img src="images/steps.png">
				<ol type="1">
					<li><strong>Familiarize:</strong> Learn about the candidates, the government offices they are running for, and any other key issues in the election.<br>
					We recommend reviewing candidates websites and candidate questionnaires, reading local news articles, and attending or viewing candidate debates and forums before voting.<br>
					If you find there is too much information, or too many candidates, one way to start is with an issue you care about (education, environment, jobs, healthcare, etc.). Then find information about the candidates and their views on that one issue.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Think and Analyze:</strong> In an election, focus more on the individual candidates, their ideas, their goals, and their solutions. Focus also on the political parties and their platforms.</li>
					<li><strong>Pick a candidate that is suited for the position:</strong> Review what you have learned about the candidates. Based on the information you know, rate the candidates either if they're good or bad, and use that information to make a good decision. Consider the candidate's background, positions, traits, goals, and any other information important to you. Decide which candidate you think will do the best job.<br>
					Tip: If you don't feel sufficiently informed about a particular office, set of candidates, or issues, you can choose to leave that category blank.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Take Action:</strong> Active citizens and leaders don't just read and think about information. They take action with it, not just words. One important opportunity for citizens to participate in democracy and in the community is by voting every year. Casting your vote in an election is not only an important decision, but it is an understated responsibility. You as a voter have a responsibility to the rest of your community members to make a decision that will benefit the greater good.</li>
					<li><strong>Always be informed and updated:</strong> After the election, look for the official election results. Keep track of the winning candidates if they stay truthful to their solutions, goals and objectives.</li>

				<h2>How to Avoid Election Misinformation and Propaganda</h2>
				<img src="images/misinformation.jpg">
				<ol type="1">
					<li><strong>Use trusted sources</strong><br>Not all sources are credible which is why people should always be careful when reading articles especially on political candidates. Reputable sources tend to provide countless information that are accurate.</li>
					<li><strong>Look at other sources</strong><br>Utilize the internet by checking multiple trustworthy sources to verify the information. If the information is true, it should be published by several sources. Be wary of information that are only found on one source because it may indicate that it is false.</li>
					<li><strong>Report false information on social media</strong><br>Spreading awareness on these by reporting it will help other voters to avoid misinformation and make well-informed decisions on which candidate to vote for.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Use critical-thinking</strong><br>Using critical-thinking will help voters assess the validity of the information they're receiving. It allows voters to recognize when information is intended to appeal to their emotions rather than present objective facts.
					</li>

				<h2>Encouragement for Fellow Citizens to Vote Wisely</h2>
				<img src="images/encourage.jpg">
				<p>Voting is one of the most powerful rights that citizens have in a democratic society. It allows people to choose their leaders and have a say in important decisions that affect their daily lives. However, it is not enough to simply voteâ€”it is important to vote wisely. Making informed choices during elections helps ensure a better future for everyone. Every vote plays a role in shaping a country's future. The leaders chosen in an election make decisions on issues such as healthcare, education, employment, and security. When citizens participate in voting, they help decide who will make these important choices on their behalf.<br>
				Instead of voting based on emotions or personal preferences, consider who will work for the country's progress in the long run. When people vote based on knowledge rather than pressure or influence, they help elect leaders who are honest, capable, and dedicated to public service. This leads to better policies, improved governance, and a stronger nation.
